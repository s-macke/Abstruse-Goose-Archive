### Comment
And that's my story... and my warning.
<p>I hope the code wasn't too buggy. It was a rush job.
<p>Actually, many of you really have been asking where I've been. It's kind of a long story. I never really planned to stop updating this site but sometimes life just happens.</p>
<p>Anyway, now that I'm able to get back into the grind, I will be posting again. I probably won't be updating on a regular schedule (not right away anyway) but I will post when I can, so check back once in a while.</p>
<p>In the meantime, <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180203193852/http://abstrusegoose.com/feedthegoose">remember to feed the goose</a></strong> to help keep me alive (literally).</p>
<p>Stay awesome.</p>
<p>GO EAGLES!</p>
