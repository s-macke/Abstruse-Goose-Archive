### Comment
One windy day two monks were arguing about a flapping flag.

The first said, "I say the flag is moving, not the wind."  The

second said, "I say the wind is moving, not the flag."  A third

monk passed by and said, "The wind is not moving.  The

flag is not moving.  Your <em>minds</em> are moving."
