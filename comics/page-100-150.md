One windy day two monks were arguing about a flapping flag.

The first said, "I say the flag is moving, not the wind."  The

second said, "I say the wind is moving, not the flag."  A third

monk passed by and said, "The wind is not moving.  The

flag is not moving.  Your <em>minds</em> are moving."

Just for the record,

I will be at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180119012957/http://abstrusegoose.com/secretarchives/i-waited-all-day" target="_blank"><strong>Starbucks on the corner of 34th and Walnut</strong></a>

in Philadelphia tomorrow around 7-ish.

Just thought I'd throw that out there.



<strong>EDIT:</strong> Before there's any misunderstanding, I should probably say

that I will not actually be at the Starbucks... unless of course

you're the SnorgTees Girl... in which case I'll be sitting in the

far corner wearing a blue baseball cap reading the latest issue

of Wired... but not really.
