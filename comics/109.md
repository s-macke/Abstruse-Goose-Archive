Just for the record,

I will be at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180119012957/http://abstrusegoose.com/secretarchives/i-waited-all-day" target="_blank"><strong>Starbucks on the corner of 34th and Walnut</strong></a>

in Philadelphia tomorrow around 7-ish.

Just thought I'd throw that out there.



<strong>EDIT:</strong> Before there's any misunderstanding, I should probably say

that I will not actually be at the Starbucks... unless of course

you're the SnorgTees Girl... in which case I'll be sitting in the

far corner wearing a blue baseball cap reading the latest issue

of Wired... but not really.
