Let's get one thing straight.  Aquaman <em>is</em> cool.

When I was little, I wanted to be Aquaman so I could talk to my goldfish.



But what about poor Scienceman?

He may be overly idealistic about the potential of science, but his heart is in the right place.

Unfortunately, he gets no respect.  But you <em>can</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180119005817/http://cosmicvariance.com/2008/10/01/donorschoose-challenge/"><strong>help Scienceman</strong></a>.

It's always the simple things that get me.

OK, maybe you don't find that equation as fascinating as I do.

But I also get distracted by shiny objects and Wheel of Fortune.

<em>For want of a nail the shoe was lost.

For want of a shoe the horse was lost.

For want of a horse the rider was lost.

For want of a rider the battle was lost.

For want of a battle the kingdom was lost.

And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.</em>
